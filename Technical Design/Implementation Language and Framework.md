# Mini-Mobile Development Process
This developer guide will instruct our developers on implementing the desired technical tools to guarantee that the application produces minimal bugs, allows the implementation stage to be more feasible, and ensures the customer is beyond satisfied. 


## Coding Style
    - Indent to help organize which elements are within each other.  

    - Use Camel Case when naming variables.

    - Name variables with at least the first three letters of each word used. 

    - Keep functions within at most 30 lines of code.

    - Use comments when describing data structures and algorithms to complete a task.


## Why Java? 
    - Our team decided to choose Java as our implementation language because most of our development team's skills are based heavily on Java.
    
    - In the application, we will use of different functions and object-oriented programming to create organization and decrease complexity. 
    
    - Due to this, we also used Java an exceptional programming language for object-oriented programming and incorporating functions since many of the embedded classes and objects within our Java IDEs are made to support this.

## Why Swing?

Java Swing is an established and reliable platform for creating desktop Java applications. It offers an extensive collection of tools and GUI components for developing interactive user interfaces. Because of Swing's flexibility, we can create unique user interfaces for our e-commerce desktop application.

Swing's extensive feature set makes it possible to design responsive and user-friendly interfaces that improve the user experience. A number of considerations went into the selection of Java Swing for our group's desktop e-commerce application :

 - **Platform Independence:** Java Swing applications are platform-independent, allowing our e-commerce application to run seamlessly on different operating systems without significant modifications.

- **Mature and Stable:** Swing has been a part of the Java Edition for many years, making it a mature and stable framework. This reliability is crucial for an e-commerce application handling transactions and inventory management.

- **Extensive Documentation and Community Support:** Java Swing benefits from extensive documentation and a large community of developers. This ensures that your team has access to resources, tutorials, and community support to overcome challenges and efficiently develop the application.

- **Integration Capabilities:** Swing supports easy integration with backend systems and databases, facilitating the seamless management of product listings, orders, and customer data for a miniature car e-commerce platform.

 - **Customization and Theming:** The flexibility of Swing allows your team to create a customized and detailed user interface which provides a unique look and feel for our e-commerce application. This is essential for creating a visually appealing shopping experience.

By utilizing Java Swing's capabilities, our group aims to deliver a reliable, cross-platform, and visually engaging desktop application tailored to the specific requirements of selling miniature cars in the e-commerce domain.
