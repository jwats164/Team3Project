# Mini-Mobile Development Process
This developer guide will instruct our developers on implementing the desired technical tools to guarantee that the application produces minimal bugs, allows the implementation stage to be more feasible, and ensures the customer is beyond satisfied. 


## Coding Style
    - Indent to help organize which elements are within each other.  

    - Use Camel Case when naming variables.

    - Name variables with at least the first three letters of each word used. 

    - Keep functions within at most 30 lines of code.

    - Use comments when describing data structures and algorithms to complete a task.


## Why Java? 
    - Our team decided to choose Java as our implementation language because most of our development team's skills are based heavily on Java.
    
    - In the application, we will use of different functions and object-oriented programming to create organization and decrease complexity. 
    
    - Due to this, we also used Java an exceptional programming language for object-oriented programming and incorporating functions since many of the embedded classes and objects within our Java IDEs are made to support this.
