# Technology Description

In this section, we will outline the technologies chosen for our project and briefly explain why we selected them.

## Language(s)

- **Java**: We have chosen Java as the primary programming language for our desktop application. Java is a versatile and widely-used language known for its platform independence, making it suitable for creating cross-platform applications that can run on various operating systems without modification. Additionally, all of the members of our group have experience working with Java and its frameworks, so it'll be convinent for us to use Java since we are comfortable with the language.

## Framework(s)

- **Swing Framework**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI) of our desktop application, we have opted to use the Swing framework. Swing provides a robust set of components and tools for creating interactive and visually appealing user interfaces in Java. Its flexibility and extensive documentation make it an excellent choice for our project.

## Storage Plan

- **SQLite**: To store and manage data generated by our application, we have selected SQLite as our database management system. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained database engine that is well-suited for desktop applications. Its simplicity and efficiency make it an ideal choice for managing miniature car sales data.

## Operating Environment(s)

- **Cross-Platform**: Our desktop application will be designed to run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Java's platform independence ensures that our application can be used seamlessly on these different platforms.

## Other Software Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: To build and run our Java-based application, users will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on their systems.
